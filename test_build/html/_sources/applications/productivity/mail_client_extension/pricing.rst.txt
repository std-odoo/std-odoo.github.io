In-App Purchase
===============

| *Lead Generation* is an *In-App Purchase (IAP)* service, which requires prepaid credits to be
  used. Each request consumes one credit.
| To buy credits, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Contacts --> Partner Autocomplete or Odoo IAP -->
  View My Services` and select a package.

.. note::
   - If you run out of credits, the only information populated when clicking on the suggested
     company is the website link and logo.
   - If you are on Odoo Online (SAAS) and have the Enterprise version, you benefit from free
     trial credits to test the feature.
